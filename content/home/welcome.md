We are interested in the emergence in active/living matter. From cellular cytoskeleton to animal groups, these systems ubiquitously exhibit novel "microscopic" dynamics which, subsequently lead to fascinating collective behaviors. To uncover the mysteries behind these phenomena, we use theoretical modeling with the help of computer simulations. Our research is interest oriented, involving various subjects in active/living matter, e.g. bacterial colonies, active fluids and their interfaces, and systems with broken Newton's 3rd law. Go ahead and explor this site if you'd like to know more :).
