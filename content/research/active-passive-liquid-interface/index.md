 Controlling interfaces of phase separating fluid mixtures is key to creating diverse functional soft materials. Traditionally, this is accomplished with surface-modifying agents. Using experiment and theory, we study how mechanical activity shapes soft interfaces that separate active and passive fluids. Chaotic flows in the active fluid give rise to giant interfacial fluctuations and non-inertial propagating active waves. At high activities, stresses disrupt interface continuity and drive droplet generation, producing an active emulsion- like steady-state with finite-sized droplets. When in contact with a solid boundary, active interfaces exhibit non-equilibrium wetting transitions, where pow- ered by the active stress fluid climbs the wall against gravity. These results demonstrate the promise of mechanically driven interfaces for creating a new class of soft active matter.
