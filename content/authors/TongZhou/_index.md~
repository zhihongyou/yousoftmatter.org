Zihan Guo graduated from Jiangxi Normal University majored in Physics. In September, 2022, he joined the group as a Master student, doubling our group size :). He is interested in the dynamics of colloidal particles immersed in active fluids, and is now performing state-of-the-art simulations of such systems.
