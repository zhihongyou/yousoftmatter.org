Yulin Li received his Bachelor in Physics from Xiamen University in 2021. Right after that, he was admitted to the PhD program in the physics department and has done some excellent work on identifying protein composition from experimental data using machine learning. Recently, he became interested in the self-organization in cellular systems, particularly, growing bacterial colonies.
