Meet Zihan Guo (郭子晗), the FIRST student in our group! Zihan recently received his Bachelor degree in Physics from Jiangxi Normal University. He has done some very nice simulations on three-body motion during his undergrade. In the coming years, he will try to develop a code to simulate colloidal particles immersed in active fluids. Welcome, Zihan!
