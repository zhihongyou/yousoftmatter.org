abstract: We study the dynamics of a tunable 2D active nematic liquid crystal composed
  of microtubules and kinesin motors confined to an oil–water interface. Kinesin motors
  continuously inject mechanical energy into the system through ATP hydrolysis, powering
  the relative microscopic sliding of adjacent microtubules, which in turn generates
  macroscale autonomous flows and chaotic dynamics. We use particle image velocimetry
  to quantify two-dimensional flows of active nematics and extract their statistical
  properties. In agreement with the hydrodynamic theory, we find that the vortex areas
  comprising the chaotic flows are exponentially distributed, which allows us to extract
  the characteristic system length scale. We probe the dependence of this length scale
  on the ATP concentration, which is the experimental knob that tunes the magnitude
  of the active stress. Our data suggest a possible mapping between the ATP concentration
  and the active stress that is based on the Michaelis–Menten kinetics that governs
  the motion of individual kinesin motors.
