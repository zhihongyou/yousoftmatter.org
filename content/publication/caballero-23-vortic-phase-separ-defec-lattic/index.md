**Abstract**:

We use numerical simulations and linear stability analysis to study the dynamics of an active liquid crystal film on a substrate in the regime where the passive system would be isotropic. Extensile activity builds up local orientational order and  destabilizes the quiescent isotropic state above a critical activity value, eventually resulting in spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics akin to the one observed ubiquitously in the nematic state. Here we show that tuning substrate friction yields a variety of emergent structures at intermediate activity, including lattices of flow vortices with associated regular arrangements of topological defects and a new state where flow vortices trap pairs of $+1/2$ defect that chase each other tail. \mcmrev{These chiral units spontaneously pick the sense of rotation and organize in a hexagonal lattice, surrounded by a diffuse flow of opposite rotation to maintain zero net vorticity.} The length scale of these emergent structures is set by the screening length $l_\eta=\sqrt{\eta/\Gamma}$ of the flow, controlled by the shear viscosity  $\eta$ and the substrate friction $\Gamma$, and can be captured by simple mode selection of the vortical flows. We demonstrate that the emergence of coherent structures can be interpreted as a phase separation of vorticity, where friction plays a role akin to that of birth/death processes in breaking conservation of the phase separating species and selecting a characteristic scale for the patterns. Our work shows that friction provides an experimentally accessible tuning parameter for designing controlled active flows.
